# CodePythonOnIos üêçüì±

> A free and easy solution for on-the-fly Python development on iOS devices using iSH Shell and a web-based code editor.

## üìù Overview

iOS development can be restrictive when it comes to executing arbitrary code. This project provides a straightforward solution by combining iSH Shell (a Linux-like environment) with a web-based application, enabling Python development directly on your iOS device.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### 1. Install iSH Shell
[![Download on the App Store](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-App%20Store-blue.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243)
- Search for "iSH Shell" on the App Store or use the link above
- Install the application (it's free!)

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
Launch iSH Shell and run the following commands:
```bash
# Install Python 3
apk add python3

# Install Git
apk add git
```

### 3. Project Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gsingh225/CodePythonOnIos

# Navigate to project directory
cd CodePythonOnIos

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Shared Memory
```bash
# Create and mount shared memory
mkdir -p /dev/shm
mount -t tmpfs -o size=512M tmpfs /dev/shm
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: After configuring shared memory, restart iSH Shell:
> 1. Swipe up to view app dock
> 2. Close iSH Shell
> 3. Relaunch the application

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CodePythonOnIos
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

3. Open your preferred browser and visit localhost, url and port should be outputted to your shell, if not try [this](http://127.0.0.1:5000) which is the default url of `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web-based Python editor

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- IOS will sometimes close ish shell when it is running the scrip causing it to not work as intended. Update/workaround coming as soon as the code editor is updated.
- The terminal may not work as a full scale terminal, it is designed for just installing packages using pip until I can expand this project further.
- On most IOS devices this app was tested on, every time you interact with the web app (run code/enter a terminal command/ visit localhost in the browser, ect) it won't load until you open ish shell and then go back to your web browser. This is also due to ios's restrictions, the same ones that cause issue #1. Updates/workarounds adressing this issue and issue #1 will be coming soon.

## üìã Requirements

- iOS device
- iSH Shell
- Internet connection (for initial setup)

## üìÑ License

[Insert License Information Here] - In case this is unclear, I have not yet decided on a license. I'll get arund to it when I deal with the frontend.
